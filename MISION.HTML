     I had a great weekend. On Friday afternoon, I finished work at 5 PM. I went home and took a shower. Then I went to see a couple of my friends at a bar downtown. 

We had a couple of beers and a nice talk. 

Tom told us about his new job, and Jim told us about his new girlfriend. After a while, we went to a restaurant and had pizza. I went to bed late that night, but I was very happy.

On Saturday morning I went running in the park. I ran 5 kilometers, and then came home.

After that, I met my girlfriend for lunch. We went to a Thai restaurant near my house. I love Thai food!

I spent the evening with my girlfriend, watching TV on the sofa.

The next day, I got up and caught the train to my parents’ town. I usually go to see my parents on Sundays, at least twice a month.

My mom usually makes a roast, and we go for a walk in the park or in the country after lunch.

This weekend was a bit different, though. My parents took me out for a nice lunch, because it was my birthday. After lunch, we took a walk (as usual) and then I caught the train back to London.

Now it’s Monday and I’m back at work, but I’ve got big plans for next weekend!</li>
